# Markbook

Markbook is a personal project of mine to help me keep track of my high school students' science topic test results!

## Background and Motivation

I wanted to ensure I had somewhere to store the test results of each student, so I could see their progress overtime.

However, everytime I finish marking a class' topic tests, I spend at least 2 hours adding up the marks, calculating averages, ranking the students etc.

So then I created a very simple command-line argument program to add the total exam mark, which printed out a short summary of their results. This was then scuffily copied and pasted into a Microsoft Word Document. Now I just have many unorganised documents in folders everywhere, but does not allow me to see a student's progress overtime!!

Once this project is properly developed, maybe I could even deploy it and use it at a bigger scale i.e. give to my colleagues to use for their students : )
